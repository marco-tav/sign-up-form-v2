# Sign-up form v2

A restart of sign-up form to make it responsive and mobile-first.


## Status

There is some undesired scrolling to be rid of. Also, all of the client-side validation of the input is yet to be done (the most important part, to be honest). Another issue that remains unsolved is dealing with the order change of the input elements between mobile and desktop versiones (all inputs in a single column in mobile vs. two columns in desktop).
